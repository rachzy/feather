<h1 align="center">Feather Remote ðŸ“±</h1>
<p>A mobile app that I created to improve my skills on React Native, Typescript and Python (server-side with Flask). The app is basically a remote controller for a fictional hoverboard, which the user can make it fly higher or lower, change the speed limit, change the flashlight color, check the battery, turn it on and off, etc.</p>
<h3>MIB</h3>
<p>MIB is a fictional company that I created in my head, and it's a slang to "Made In Brazil", which would be a company that would make "futuristic" technologies, and would be focused on building the future. In other words, MIB would bring the future and sci-fi to reality</p>
<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
<b>Front-end:</b> The app is being developed with React Native (Expo) + TypeScript. 
<br>
<b>Back-end:</b> The server side is being developed using Python (Flask) and MongoDB as database
